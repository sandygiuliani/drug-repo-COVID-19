# drug-repo-COVID-19
A poor attempt at recycling existing drugs for COVID-19 (yeah, yeah the virus is called SARS-Cov-2) by recycling an old drug repurposing script. I haven't coded in years. I didn't know databases were a thing so it's all a nested dictionaries mess. Someone help.

So far I have justed cloned this repo and copied across the old script and I am already tired.
